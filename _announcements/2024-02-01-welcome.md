We are excited to welcome you to the Spring 2024 offering of COMPSCI 370 class!

A few organizational moments:
- **Lectures.**
  This year, we will offer an in-class section of the course.
  You can find the links to all materials, including lecture slides and recordings on lectures page.
- **Logistics.** Please make sure to familiarize yourself with the class logistics.
- **Homework assignments** will appear on Piazza. We will also post a note on Piazza when that happens along with the deadlines. Grading and submission will be done via Gradescope.

We are looking forward to a productive semester working with you!
