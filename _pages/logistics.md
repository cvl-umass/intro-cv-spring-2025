### Textbooks
The primary material for the class are lectures and readings from books, research papers,
articles listed on the lectures page. There is no required textbook for this class. Nevertheless the
following textbooks are useful:

* [Computer Vision: A Modern Approach](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/book/book.html) by David Forsyth and Jean Ponce (2nd ed.)
* [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications](https://szeliski.org/Book/), by Richard Szeliski
  (2nd ed.) (available online).
  
We will post links to sections of Szeliski's book for each lecture.

And these for machine learning:
* [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/) by Kevin P. Murphy
* [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/), T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and
J. Friedman
* [Pattern Recognition and Machine
  Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf),
  Christopher M. Bishop (available online)
* [Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html), Tom M. Mitchell
* [A Course in Machine Learning](http://ciml.info/), Hal Daumé III
  (available online)
* [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), Goodfellow,
  Bengio, and Courville (available online)

### Required Background

The course assumes a strong ability to program in Python and
background in linear algebra, probability and statistics. Take a look
at the resources below to brush up your math and programming skills.

* [NumPy tutorial from Stanford CS231n](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
* [Vector geometry notes by Denis Sevee](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/teaching/670/vectornotes.pdf)
* [Linear algebra review](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi05/cse252a/linear_algebra_review.pdf) (via David Kriegman)
* [Random variables review](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi05/cse252a/random_var_review.pdf) (via David Kriegman)
* Deep learning: [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Writing is a key component of all projects. [Here are some tips on
how to write
well](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cWY-L6Qu-wHKst69aDuJbi7Vtw472ZaSNHkrS_WyzqE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Grading

The grading breakdown for this class is as follows:

* 80% Homeworks (5 in total)
* 20% Project

*Note that this class does not have any tests or exams.*

The cutoffs for letter grades vary each year, but here are the
cutoffs we used in a previous offering of the class: **A** (92), **A-** (87), **B+**
(83), **B** (79), **B-** (75), **C+** (70), **C** (65), **C-** (60), **D+** (55), **D** (50).

### Homework Assignments

There will be 5 homework assignments over the course of the semester.
These assignments may contain material that has been covered by
published papers and webpages.
It is a graduate class and we expect students to solve the problems
themselves rather than search for answers.


#### Collaboration Policy

**Homework assignments must be done individually:** This means that
each student must hand in their own answers. However, it is acceptable
to collaborate when figuring out answers and to help each other solve
the problems. We will be assuming that, as participants in a graduate
course, you will be taking the responsibility to make sure you
personally understand the solution arising from such collaboration.

You also must indicate on each homework with whom you have collaborated.

#### Late Policy

* You can use 7 late days, with up to 3 late days per
  assignment. Beyond 3 late days the assignment will not be counted at all.
* Once you have used all 7 late days, penalty is 25% for each
  additional late day.
* We will use your latest submission for grading and for calculating
  your late day usage. 
* There is no bonus if you don’t use late days at all.

#### Regrade Policy

If you feel that we have made a mistake in grading your homework,
please submit a regrading request on Gradescope and we will consider
your request. Please note that regrading of a homework may cause your
grade to go either up or down.


***

### Project

The project will be carried out in groups of 2 people, and has four
main parts: a proposal, a midway report, a final report, and a
poster/oral presentation. The project is an integral part of this
class, and is designed to be as similar as possible to researching and
writing a conference-style paper.

Please see the project page for more information about the final
project.

***
### Auditing

To satisfy the auditing requirement, you must do _one_ of the
following:

1. **Submit two homeworks** and receive at least 75% of the points on
   each one.
2. **Submit one homework** and **do a class project** which must
   address a topic related to computer vision and must be somthing
   that you have started while taking the class (i.e. it can't be your
   previous work). You will need to submit a project proposal with
   everyone else, present the project with everyone, and write the
   final report. You must get at least 75% of the points in both the
   homework and the project.

### Accommodation Statement
The University is committed to providing an equal educational
opportunity for all students. If you have a documented physical,
psychological, or learning disability on file with Disability Services
(DS), you may be eligible for reasonable academic accommodations to
help you succeed in this course. If you have a documented disability
that requires an accommodation, please notify me within the first two
weeks of the semester so that we may make appropriate arrangements.

### Academic Honesty
Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of
higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research,
academic honesty is required of all students. Students are expected to
be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of
academic integrity (http://www.umass.edu/honesty).
