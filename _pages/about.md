This course will cover the fundamentals of teaching computers to "see" like humans. Topics to be explored include the design of cameras, image representation in computers, light and color perception, detecting lines and corners in images, estimating optical flow and alignment between image pairs, and developing algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Advanced topics may also be covered if time permits. The course schedule can be found on the [lectures](lectures/) page.

The course will emphasize mathematical foundations rather than relying on software packages. A strong background in mathematics, including probability, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and programming, is required. Familiarity with Python is helpful but not mandatory, as students will receive Python programming instruction during the course. The official prerequisites for the course are a grade of 'C' or better in CMPSCI 240 or CMPSCI 383. Additional course information, including expectations and policies, can be found on the [logistics](logistics/) page.
